# react-redux-demo

This project contains the stream of work from this pluralsight [course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6/table-of-contents).

You can find the example set up for this course in this [repository](https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter).  It is a simplified version of the popular [react-slingshot project](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot).
